                          Claims lists the names of resources, defined in spec.resourceClaims,
                          that are used by this container.


                          This is an alpha field and requires enabling the
                          DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate.


                          This field is immutable. It can only be set for containers.

                                Name must match the name of one entry in pod.spec.resourceClaims of
                                the Pod where this field is used. It makes that resource available
                                inside a container.
